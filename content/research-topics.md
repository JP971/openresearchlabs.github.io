Research topics
===============

**We focus on computational analysis of complex natural and social
systems.** We blend elements from machine learning/AI, statistical and
probabilistic programming, complex systems, and data science in order
to develop novel, targeted techniques to extract information and
insights from rich data streams based on combinations of human and
machine intelligence. We coordinate open developer communities that
help to translate latest theoretical advances into accessible methods
to inform modeling, experimentation, and decision-making. **Key
applications** include microbiome research, population studies, and
computational humanities.

<!--We are members of the [Open Knowledge
Finland Open Science work group](https://fi.okfn.org/wg/openscience/),
which received **Open Science and Research award of the Ministry of
Education and Culture in 2017**, and active contributors in the
**national FIN-CLARIAH research infrastructure for computational
humanities**.-->
